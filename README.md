# ðŸ“˜ Daily DSA Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!  
This repo contains daily solutions to problems I'm solving while following **[Striver's DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)**.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Complete the entire Striverâ€™s DSA Sheet.
- Build strong coding interview foundations.
- Maintain consistency and discipline.

## ðŸ“Œ Note

> These solutions only include the part of the code visible and editable on platforms like GFG/LeetCode (i.e., function implementation). Full boilerplate or I/O handling is not included unless necessary.
